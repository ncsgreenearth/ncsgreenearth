Conventional Chemical cleaners only “SHIFTS” the dirt, while creating toxic fumes and polluting water. 

 

D’Solve in contrast converts the dirt into safe natural forms – soil, water, CO2, without creating any pollution. It manages cleanliness continuously by creating a **Bio Film** on cleaned surface. This **Bio-Film** is like your Security Force which Kills Germs & Pathogens, inhibits their development, Resists accumulation of waste by constant cleaning, Spreads to un-reachable areas, pipelines, valves etc. for extended cleaning, Delivers a smooth, efficient, clean and sanitized discharge system.
