This **Bio-Film** is like your Security Force which Kills Germs & Pathogens, inhibits their development, Resists accumulation of waste by constant cleaning, Spreads to un-reachable areas, pipelines, valves etc. for extended cleaning, Delivers a smooth, efficient, clean and sanitized discharge system.
